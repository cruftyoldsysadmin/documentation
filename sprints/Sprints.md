### Sprints

## Sprint 1:
Develop a Command Line interfact to interact with the ixo protocol.  It will simply store and retrieve data from the IPBD test network.

Some of the commands would normally be executed on the client, but have been added to to the CLI spec to ensure that we can run end to end tests.

## Sprint 2 (Draft):
Focus on building Smart Contracts for the ixo token and specify the ledgering of the DIX projects, Impact Claims and Evaluations onto the blockchain
